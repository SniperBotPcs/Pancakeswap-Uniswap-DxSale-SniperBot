The bot allows you to buy any newly added tokens on PancakeSwap and UniSwap at staggering speeds (up to zero seconds from listing date). It is called “sniping” which can bring you a large amount of profit.

This is how the bot works: by connecting to the blockchain network, scanning all mempool / pending transactions, finding and matching the liquidity addition of the token you are trying to withdraw, and then placing a buy order on the same block. At the same time, if you enter a purchase when pancakeswap or uniswap liquidity is given in another mode, it will buy in the same second.

- What is a Mempool ?

The memory pool is where all valid transactions wait to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network. Once a transaction is verified by the node, it waits in this pool until it is received by a Bitcoin miner and placed in a block.
